# YouTube Lecture to PDF Converter

This Python project allows you to convert a YouTube lecture video into a PDF of screenshots. The app extracts frames from the video at specified intervals and compiles them into a PDF file. It uses `yt-dlp` for downloading YouTube videos, `opencv-python` for frame extraction, and `img2pdf` for creating the PDF.

## Features

- Download YouTube videos.
- Extract frames at user-defined intervals.
- Generate a PDF of the extracted frames.
- Simple and interactive Streamlit-based UI.
